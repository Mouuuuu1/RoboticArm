# Robotic Arm – Graduation Project  

A 6-DOF robotic arm designed and implemented as part of my graduation project.  
The system is powered by an **AVR ATmega32 microcontroller** and combines servo/stepper motors, an LCD + keypad interface, and EEPROM-based task automation.

## ⚙️ Features  
- **6 Servo Motors** – control the robotic arm joints.  
- **Gripper Mechanism** – powered by a servo motor and push buttons.  
- **LCD & Keypad Interface** – allows manual control and user-friendly interaction.  
- **EEPROM Integration** – records and replays tasks for automation.  
- **Task Playback** – enables repetitive actions without reprogramming.
